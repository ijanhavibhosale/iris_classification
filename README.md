# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Project

A complete **data analysis and machine learning** project using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This project uses the classic **Iris dataset** to classify iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

---

## ðŸ§  What the Model Does

- Loads and explores the **Iris dataset** (from `sklearn.datasets`).
- Performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
- Splits and **scales the data** using `StandardScaler`.
- Trains a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model.
- Evaluates model performance using **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **Accuracy**: ~96% on test data
- **Model**: KNN with `k=3`
- **Data Insights**:
  - Petal length and width are the most important features.
  - Visual separation between species is strong in pair plots.
- Confusion matrix and heatmap show very few misclassifications.
